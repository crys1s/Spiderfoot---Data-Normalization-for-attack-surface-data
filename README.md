**Project Overview:**

This GitHub project enhances the SpiderFoot open-source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool by combining output normalization with the capability to perform Nmap and technology-specific scans on the collected intelligence. The goal is to provide a comprehensive solution that not only standardizes SpiderFoot output but also extends its functionality by integrating additional scanning capabilities.

**Key Features:**

**Output Normalization Module:**

The core feature of this project is an output normalization module for SpiderFoot, which transforms raw output into a standardized and consistent format.
Normalized output improves usability, making it easier for analysts to interpret and compare results across different scans.
Customization options allow users to define specific normalization rules to suit their analysis requirements.

**Nmap Integration:**

The project includes an integration of the Nmap tool, allowing users to perform network scans on identified hosts from SpiderFoot output.
Nmap scans enhance the depth of intelligence by providing detailed information about open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.

**Technology-Specific Scans:**

Additional scanning modules are introduced to perform technology-specific scans on identified hosts.
These scans focus on extracting detailed information about the technologies and services running on the target infrastructure.

**Automation Scripts:**

Automation scripts are provided to streamline the entire process, from SpiderFoot output normalization to running Nmap and technology scans.
Users can easily incorporate the enhanced scanning capabilities into their SpiderFoot workflows for a more seamless and efficient analysis.
